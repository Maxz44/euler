# Multiples of 3 and 5
# If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9.
# The sum of these multiples is 23.
# Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

# Even Fibonacci numbers

# Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms.
# By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
# 
# 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
# 
# By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million,
# find the sum of the even-valued terms.
